## Simple Random Sampling

### Find Sample Size

N<- 21
B <- 3450
std <- sd(worldcup$Averageattendance)
(N*(std^2))/((N-1)*(B^2/(4))+std^2)

### Take Simple Random Sample

## Stratified Random Sampling
We are going to stratify this data by the continent that the tournament was held in.
We are using three different continents, which will be Europe, South America, and other.
Russia will count in the Europe category.
### Find Sample Size




N <- c(5,11,5 )
s2 <- c( , , )
B <- 
a <- 1/length(N)
n <- sum(N^2*s2/a)/((sum(N))^2*B^2/4+sum(N*s2))
n
n*a

### Take Stratified Random Sample


sample_n()


## Systematic Random Sampling

### Find Sample Size

N <- 21
s2 <- (sd(worldcup$Averageattendance))^2
B <- 3450

(N*s2)/((N-1)*(B^2)/(4)+s2)

### Take Systematic Random Sample


##Getting a 1-in-
k<- 
#Select the first term
starting <- sample(x = k,size = 1)
#Select every 10th passenger
samples <- seq(starting,nrow(worldcup),by=k)
#Collect age data for our sample
values <- worldcup[samples,]
